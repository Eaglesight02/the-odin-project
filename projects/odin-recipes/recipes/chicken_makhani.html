    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Makhani, also known as Butter Chicken, is a North Indian delicacy renowned for its creamy texture and rich flavor profile. Tender pieces of chicken are marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, then simmered in a velvety tomato-based sauce enriched with butter, cream, and aromatic spices like garam masala. The aroma of roasted fenugreek leaves and Kashmiri red chili powder adds depth to the dish, while the succulent chicken, coated in the luscious sauce, melts in your mouth, leaving behind a harmonious balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy notes that linger on the palate, making it an irresistible indulgence for lovers of Indian cuisine.
