    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hyderabadi Dum Biryani is a culinary masterpiece originating from Hyderabad, India. It's a dish where fragrant Basmati rice is layered with marinated meat (usually chicken or mutton), caramelized onions, and a meld of spices, then slow-cooked in a sealed pot (drum) to infuse every grain with rich flavors.</p>
    <p>When served, the tender meat, infused with the essence of the spices, melts in your mouth, while the perfectly cooked rice, delicately flavored and adorned with fried onions and fresh herbs, completes the experience, leaving a lingering taste that embodies the essence of Hyderabadi cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 1:</b><br>Place black pepper corns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 2:</b><br>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 3:</b><br>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paster, chilli powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator, for about 2 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 4:</b><br>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still firm, for about 5 minutes. Then drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 5:</b><br>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 6:</b><br>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chilli peppers; cook and stir until fragrance is felt, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 7:</b><br>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Step 8:</b><br>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</p>
