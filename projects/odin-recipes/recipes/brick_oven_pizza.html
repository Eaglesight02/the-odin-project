                        Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let it stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.

                        <b>Step 2:</b><br>
                        Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.

                        Be sure to use a big enough container to allow the dough to rise.

                        <b>Step 5:</b><br>
                        Preheat the oven with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.

                    <p>
                        <b>Step 7:</b><br>
                        Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top.
                        Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the top.

                        <b>Step 8:</b><br>
                        With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure the dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back
                        of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.

                        <b>Step 9:</b><br>
                        Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to show brown color, 4 to 6 minutes.

                        of the basil leaves randomly on the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
